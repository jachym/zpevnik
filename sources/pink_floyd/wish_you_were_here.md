1. So, so you think you can tell,
               Am                    G
   Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
                       D                     C               
   Can you tell, green field from cold steel rail,
              Am
   smile from veil,
                        G
   Do you think you can tell?
   
                           C                     D
2. And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts,
                 Am                 G                      
   Hot ashes for trees, hot air for cool breeze,
                     D
   cold comfort for change,
                 C                          Am
   And did you exchange walk on part in the war
                    G
   for lead role in cage?

3. How I wish, how I wish you were here.
              Am                                    
   We're just two lost souls swimming in fish bowl,
   G
   year after year,
   D                                      C
   Running over the same old ground. What have we found?
                Am                   G
   The same old fears. Wish you were here!
