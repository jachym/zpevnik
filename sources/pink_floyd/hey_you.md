1. Hey you out there in the cold
                                        Hmi
   Getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me
       Emi
   Hey you standing in the aisles
                                              Hmi
   with itchy feet and fading smiles, can you feel me
       D                               G D  C
   Hey you don't help them to bury the light
   Hmi           Ami         Emi Dmi
   Don't give in without a fight.


       Emi
2. Hey you out there on your own 
                                         Hmi
   Sitting naked by the phone would you touch me
       Emi
   Hey you with your ear against the wall
       
   Waiting for someone to call on would you touch me
       D                                G D  C
   Hey you would you help me to carry the stone
   Hmi           Ami         Emi Dmi
   open your heart I am coming home.


   
   C          D    G  D C
R: But it was only fantasy
   C                D
   The wall was too high,
      G   D   C
   as you can see
   C                D
   No matter how he tried
            G   D     C
   he could not break free
             D                Emi
   And the worms ate into his brain
   
   Emi Dmi Emi Dmi
   
3. Hey you out there on the road
   Doing what you're told, can you help me
   Hey you out there beyond the wall
   Breaking bottles in the hall, can you help me
   Hey you don't tell me there's no hope at all
   Together we stand, divided we fall.
