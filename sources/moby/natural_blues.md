Oh lordy, trouble so hard
G
oh lordy, trouble so hard,

don't nobody know my troubles but God
Dmi

Ami
Went down the hill, the other day
my soul got happy and stayed all day
F
went down the hill, the other day
G
my soul got happy and stayed all day

Ami
Went in the room, didn't stay long,
looked on the bed and brother was dead
F
went in the room, didn't stay long,
G
looked on the bed and brother was dead
