### Lift me up

```
Bm             A 

 Plain talking 

G               Bm      A 

 Take us so far 

G             Bm           A 

 Broken down cars 

      G            Bm 

 Like strong and old start 

  

       Bm      A 

 Plain talking 

  G       Bm            A 

 Saved a soul world 

      G         Bm          A 

 We travel through hell 

  G          Bm         A 

 Now I wish hell 

  

Bm     A  G 

  

Bm 

 Lift me up, lift me up  :  

  A         G            :  4x 

 Higher now am I         : 

  

     Bm       A 

 Plain talking 

G             Bm     A 

 Making us spoilt 

     G        Bm         A 

 So stronger and cold 

G           Bm         A 

 Feeling so old 

  

       Bm       A 

 Plain talking 

  G          Bm        A 

 As you in the snow 

     G     Bm             A 

 You never know how 

    G      Bm          A     

 Sweeter than down 

  

 Bm     A  G 

  

Bm 

 Lift me up, lift me up  :  

  A         G            :   8x 

 Higher now am I         : 

  

 Pont: Bm  D  F#m  A 

  

 Bm 

 Lift me up, lift me up  :  

 A        G              :   8x 

 La la la la la          :
