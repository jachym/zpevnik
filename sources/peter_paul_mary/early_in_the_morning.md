Well early in the morning,     about the break of day,
              Bm                        Am - D7
I ask the Lord,   "Help me find the way!"
                 G C G        C            G C G
Help me find the way   to the promised     land
            Em                   A7
This lonely body needs a helping hand
          G   Em          Bm  D7          G C G C G C G
I ask the Lord to help me please find the way.
                     G C G             C       G
When the new day's a dawning, I bow my head in prayer.
              Bm                       Am - D7
I pray to the Lord, "Won't you lead me there?"
                   G C G         C      G C G
Won't you guide me safely to the Golden Stair?
                   Em               A7
Won't you let this body your burden share?
              G   Em                   Bm  D7       C  G C G C G C G C G C G C G
I pray to the Lord, "Won't you lead me please, lead me there?"
                  G C G                      G C G
When the judgment comes to find the world in shame
                 Bm                      Am - D7
When the trumpet blows won't you call my name?
                 G C G                 G C G
When the thunder rolls and the heavens rain
                   Em                 A7
When the sun turns black, never shine again
                 G   Em                   Bm  D7          G C G C G C G
When the trumpet blows, won't you call me please, call my name!
