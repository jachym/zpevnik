### Over the hills and far away

```
[Verse]
      Em
They came for him one winter's night
Em
Arrested, he was bound
Em
They said there'd been a robbery
Em
His pistol had been found
 
Em                       G
They marched him to the station house
    Em              D
He waited till the dawn
    Em               G
And as they led him to the dock
    D                   Em
He knew that he'd been wronged
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
    C     D/C        C      D/C
You stand accused of robbery
   Dsus4     D       Dsus4  D
He heard the bailiff say
   C       D/C      C  D/C
He knew without an alibi
  G/D      D           Bm         D
Tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom
 
 
[Chorus]
Em       G         D     Em
Over the hills and far away
     D         G          C          D
For ten long years, he'll count the days
Em       G         D       Em
Over the mountains and the seas
  D           G       C            D   Em
A prisoner's life for him there'll be
 
 
[Verse]
   Em                  G
He knew that it would cost him dear
    Em              D
But yet he dare not say
     Em                     G
Just where he had been that fateful night
   D              Em
A secret, it must stay
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
   Cmaj7   D/C        C        D/C
He had to fight back tears of rage
    G/D         D      G/D   D
His heart beat like a drum
    Cmaj7     D/C    C         D/C
For with the wife of his best friend
      G/D       D                  D
He'd spent his final night of freedom
 
 
[Chorus]
Em       G          D   Em
Over the hills and far away
    D        G       C        D
He swears he will return one day
Em            G         D       Em
Far from the mountains and the seas
     D       G    C          D
Back in her arms again heâ€™ll be
Em       G          D   Cmaj7       Dadd4
Over the hills and far away_______
Cmaj7
Over the hills and, over the hills and
Dadd4                          Em    Em G Em D Em G D Em
Over the hills and far away___
 
 
[Bridge]
     Cmaj7     D/C     C      D/C
Each night within his prison cell
   G/D        D          G/D    D
He looks out through the bars
    Cmaj7     D/C    C         D/C
He reads the letters that she wrote
    G/D        D       Bm        D
One day he'll know the taste of freedom
 
 
[Chorus]
Em       G          D   Em
Over the hills and far away
    D         G      C        D
She prays he will return one day
   Em       G          D         Em
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
     D       G     C           D
Back in his arms again she'll be
 
F#m       A         E   F#m
Over the hills and far away
    E          A      D        E
He swears he will return one day
   F#m         A       E       F#m
As sure as the river reach the sea
     E       A       D            E
Back in his arms is where she'll be
 
F#m       A         E   F#m
Over the hills and far away
    E         A      D        E
She prays he will return one day
   F#m          A       E        F#m
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
     E       A       D          E
Back in her arms is where he'll be
 
F#m          A     E  F#m
Over the hills___
E        A         A     E
Over the hills and far away
