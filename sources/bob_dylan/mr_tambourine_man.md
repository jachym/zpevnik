Capo III  

   G          A7             D               G
R: Hey Mister Tambourine Man play a song for me
           D                G               A7
   I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
   G          A7             D               G
   Hey Mister Tambourine Man play a song for me
          D             G                 A7        D
   in the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.

   G                           A          D             G
1. Though I know that evenings empire has returned into sand,
   D                G
   Vanished from my hand,
           D               G                   A
   Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.
      G          A             D             G
   My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
     D              G
   I have no one to meet
        D             G                     A
   And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.

2. Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship,
   My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,
   My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
   To be wandering.
   I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
   Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,
   I promise to go under it.

R: Hey Mister Tambourine Man play a song for me...

3. Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
   It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run
   And but for the sky there are no fences facing.
   And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
   To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind,
   I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're
   Seeing that he's chasing.

R: Hey Mister Tambourine Man play a song for me...

4. Then take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind,
   Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
   The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
   Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
   Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
   Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
   With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
   Let me forget about today until tomorrow.

R: Hey Mister Tambourine Man play a song for me...
