```
     Ami                D            G               Emi
Some things in life are bad they can really make you mad
      Ami                  D         G
Other things just make you swear and curse
            Ami               D
When you've chewing an life's gristle
      G              Emi
Don't grumble give a whistle
    Ami                                  D7
And this'll help things turn out for the best

    G      Emi         Ami    D7      G     
And always look on the bright side of life
    G      Emi         Ami    D7      Ami D7    
And always look on the bright side of lig-ht

   Ami                              G                Emi
If life seems jolly Drotten there's something you've forgotten
              Ami                 D         G
and that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing.
            Ami            D              G     Emi
When you've feeling in the dumps don't be silly chumps
     Ami                                      D7
Just purse your lips and whistle - that's the thing

    G      Emi         Ami    D7      G, Emi, Ami, D7
And always look on the bright side of life
           G   Emi         Ami   D7        G, Emi, Ai, D7
Come on always look on the bright side of life

For life is quite absurd and death's the final word
you must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin - give the audience a grin
Enjoy it - it's your last chance anyhow.

    G     Emi         Ami    D7      G, Emi, Ami, D7
So always look on the bright side of death
G      Emi      Ami          D7    G, Emi, Ami, D7
just before you draw your terminal breath

Ami              D    G                Emi
Life's a pice if shit when you look at it
Ami                D                   G
Life's a laugh and death's a joke it's Gtrue
       Ami            D
You'll see it's all a show
        G               Emi
keep'em laughing as you go
       Ami                              D7
just remember that the last laugh is on you
    G      Emi         Ami    D7      G, Emi, Ami, D7
And always look on the bright side of life
