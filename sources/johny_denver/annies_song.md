### Annie's Song

```
 G              C  D    Em      C            G
You fill up my senses, like a night in the forest.
 G                   C    D      Am     C           D
Like a mountain in spring time, like a walk in the rain.
 G                   C  D    Em      C           G
Like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean.
 G              C  D    Am   D        G
You fill up my senses, come fill me again.


 G             C   D   Em        C             G
Come let me love you, let me give my life for you.
  G                   C    D    Am      C           D
Let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms.
  G                 C    D   Em       C            G
Let me lay down beside you, let me always be with you.
G               C  D   Am     D       G
Come let me love you, come love me again.


G               C   D    Em       C            G
You fill up my senses, like a night in the forest.
G                   C       D    Am                G
Like a mountain in spring time, like a walk in the rain.
G                    C   D    Em          C        G
Like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean.
G               C   D    Am        D     G
You fill up my senses, come fill me again.
