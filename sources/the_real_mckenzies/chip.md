### Chip

```
[Verse 1]
Am
Chip worked as a boatwright as his father and his gran
Am                                 F       G     Am
A' working in a boatyard building on the River Thames
Am
One day Chip was hard at work, the Devil appeared from hell
Am                               F     G       Am
He held a roll of copper and a bucket full of nails
 
Am                                     G
The Devil said unto Chip, "Take these nails and copper roll
        F                              G
But you also have to take this rat and I will take your soul"
Am                             G
Chip despised the rat, and the rat squealed and hissed
                                        F        G     Am
But the bucket of nails and copper were too much to resist

Am ... F G Am (repeat first four bars of verse) 2x
 
 
[Verse 2]
Am
Chip went straight to work, he'd get rid of the rat
Am                                        F        G       Am
And there would no' be a problem with his death after the fact
Am
But the devil rat wouldn't die, no matter how hard he tried
Am                                     F       G      Am
The rat attacked the boatwright and 'e bit him in the eye
 
Am                                  G
It seemed as if the river rats fell under Satan's spell
     F                                 G
They followed Chip around and made his life a living hell
   Am                       G
He slowly lost his mind, he lost his family
   G                                F      G  Am
He lost his job and had to join the King's Navy
 
 
[Instrumental]
Am G Am G
 
 
[Chorus]
  Am
A lemon grows a pip
  F                 G
A yard will build a ship
   Am
As Satan is my master
                G
I will get you, Chip
  Am
A lemon grows a pip
                    G
A yard will build a ship
   Am            G
As Satan is my master
 
I'm gonna get you

[Verse 3]
Am
The rats chased Chip up the gangplank of the ship
Am                                        F     G       Am
And they bit him and they tortured him until he finally flipped
Am
He sniveled to the captain to turn around the rig
Am                                     F           G      Am
The captain spied his madness and they chucked him in the brig
 
Am                                 G
Now, the devil rat had his man, he knew just what to do
     F                                G
He'd command the rats and through the planks they'd chew
    Am                       G
The water rushed in, and the ship went down
        G                                   F    G      Am
She was smashed upon the rocks on which the rats danced around
 
 
[Chorus]
  Am
A lemon grows a pip
  F                 G
A yard will build a ship
   Am
As Satan is my master
                G
I will get you, Chip
  Am
A lemon grows a pip
  F                 G
A yard will build a ship
   Am
As Satan is my master
                G
I will get you, Chip
  Am
A lemon grows a pip
  F                 G
A yard will build a ship
   Am
As Satan is my master
                G
I will get you, Chip
  Am
A lemon grows a pip
  F                 G
A yard will build a ship
   Am
As Satan is my master
           Am
I GOT YOU CHIP!
