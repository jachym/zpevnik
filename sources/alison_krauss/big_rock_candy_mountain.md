One evening as the sun went down and the jungle fire was burning
         C                                            G       C
Down the track came a hobo hiking and he said, "Boys, I'm not turning"
    F            C           F    C     F         C       G
I'm headed for a land that's far away besides the crystal fountains
   C                                  G              C
So come with me, we'll go and see the Big Rock Candy Mountains
 
       C                                  F                    C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains there's a land that's fair and bright,
          F                C              F               G
where the handouts grow on bushes and you sleep out every night
          C                             F                C
Where the boxcars all are empty and the sun shines every day
       F             C            F         C          F        C
on the birds and the bees and the cigarette trees, the lemonade springs where the
F        C            G              C
bluebird sings in the Big Rock Candy Mountains
 
       C                                F                C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains all the cops have wooden legs,
        F                 C                    F                    G
and the bulldogs all have rubber teeth and the hens lay soft-boiled eggs 
    C                                        F                 C
The farmers' trees are full of fruit and the barns are full of hay
        F        C              F        C               F          C
Oh, I'm bound to go where there ain't no snow, where the rain don't fall,
    F          C           G              C
the wind don't blow in the Big Rock Candy Mountains
 
       C                            F                 C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains you never change your socks,
        F                 C              F                  G
and the little streams of alcohol come a trickling down the rocks
    C                                       F                  C
The brakemen have to tip their hats and the railroad bulls are blind
          F       C           F        C           F           C
There's a lake of stew and of whiskey too, you can paddle all around 'em in a
F      C         G              C
big canoe in the Big Rock Candy Mountains
 
       C                            F                 C
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains the jails are made of tin,
    F                  C            F               G
and you can walk right out again as soon as you are in
      C                                  F             C
There ain't no short-handled shovels, no axes, saws or picks
      F     C              F         C
I'm a gonna stay where you sleep all day, where they
F         C          F       C
hung the Turk that invented work
       G              C
in the Big Rock Candy Mountains
 
C       F   C
F C F C
 
     F       C        F      C           G              C
I'll see you all this comin' fall in the Big Rock Candy Mountains
